MMP version 2.0 has totally change the audio engine and the images management:

Instead of using the SDL2_mixer library it use the libvlc library (with which the famous media player vlc is build).

The opencv-3.0.0 library is no more needed. MMP uses gtk+-3.0 for the cover images resizing.

Nothing change for the user except that the program will never more crashing due of my missuse of the SDL2_mixer library.
