 - First release of Micro Music Player.

Wed Dec 16 22:05:20 CET 2015

 - Release of version 2.0.

    MMP version 2.0 has totally change the audio engine and the images management:

    Instead of using the SDL2_mixer library it use the libvlc library (with which the famous media player vlc is build).

    The opencv-3.0.0 library is no more needed. MMP uses gtk+-3.0 for the cover images resizing.

    Nothing change for the user except that the program will never more crashing due of my missuse of the SDL2_mixer library.
