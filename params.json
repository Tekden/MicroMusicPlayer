Here you can choose the icons set to use in the interface: 2 different sets available.\r\n\r\n    * The **HighContrast** icon set *theme*: black and white icons.\r\n\r\n    * The **Oxygen** icon set *theme*: colored icons.\r\n\r\n  2. You can choose the main size from the interface from 3 available sizes:\r\n\r\n    * **Little** size.\r\n\r\n    * **Middle** size.\r\n\r\n    * **Big** size.\r\n\r\n  3. You can set the **default folder** set by folder selector opening.\r\n\r\n  4. You can *click-on*, *click-off* the **repeat all** and **shuffle** mode to be set as you want.\r\n\r\n  5. Else you can change the **default volume intensity** (*from 0 to 128 units*, which default to 64.) to be set as the default volume intensity from the program.\r\n\r\n  Changes are immediately applied on the program, except the **default volume intensity**, but you must press the **Apply** button to store the settings, so that you can get it back at every new start from the program.\r\n \r\n  You can open a folder with MicroMusicPlayer through your file navigator or start it with the commandline:\r\n\r\n  ```bash\r\n\r\n    $ mmp folderpath # mmp is a symbolic link.\r\n  \r\n  ```\r\n\r\nmmp supported filetypes:\r\n\r\nMusic files filetypes:\r\n\r\n\r\n   + **mp3** (*MPEG-1 Audio Layer III or MPEG-2 Audio Layer III*).\r\n   + **ogg** (*Ogg Vorbis*).\r\n   + **flac** (*Free Lossless Audio Codec*).\r\n   + **wav** (*WAVEform audio file format*).\r\n   + **wma** (*Windows Media Audio*).\r\n   + **aac** (*Advanced Audio Coding*).\r\n   + **ac3** (*Dolby Digital*).\r\n   + **mid** or **midi** (*Musical Instrument Digital Interface*).\r\n   + **ape** (*Monkey’s Audio*).\r\n   + **mov** (*QuickTime*).\r\n\r\n  Else the complete supported filetypes list:\r\n\r\n    \\*.3ga\r\n    \\*.669\r\n    \\*.a52\r\n    \\*.aac\r\n    \\*.ac3\r\n    \\*.adt\r\n    \\*.adts\r\n    \\*.aif\r\n    \\*.aifc\r\n    \\*.aiff\r\n    \\*.amb\r\n    \\*.amr\r\n    \\*.aob\r\n    \\*.ape\r\n    \\*.au\r\n    \\*.awb\r\n    \\*.caf\r\n    \\*.dts\r\n    \\*.flac\r\n    \\*.it\r\n    \\*.kar\r\n    \\*.m4a\r\n    \\*.m4b\r\n    \\*.m4p\r\n    \\*.m5p\r\n    \\*.mid\r\n    \\*.mka\r\n    \\*.mlp\r\n    \\*.mod\r\n    \\*.mpa\r\n    \\*.mp1\r\n    \\*.mp2\r\n    \\*.mp3\r\n    \\*.mpc\r\n    \\*.mpga\r\n    \\*.mus\r\n    \\*.oga\r\n    \\*.ogg\r\n    \\*.oma\r\n    \\*.opus\r\n    \\*.qcp\r\n    \\*.ra\r\n    \\*.rmi\r\n    \\*.s3m\r\n    \\*.sid\r\n    \\*.spx\r\n    \\*.tak\r\n    \\*.thd\r\n    \\*.tta\r\n    \\*.voc\r\n    \\*.vqf\r\n    \\*.w64\r\n    \\*.wav\r\n    \\*.wma\r\n    \\*.wv\r\n    \\*.xa\r\n    \\*.xm\r\n\r\n\r\n## What mmp not do:\r\n\r\n**mmp** provide nothing else features:\r\n\r\n  + **No** music library indexing feature.\r\n\r\n  + **No** access to music files metadatas.\r\n\r\n  + **No** playing timeline (*Maybe it fail to the program*) so that you cannot set the position from the current playing music file.\r\n\r\n  + **No** database connection for cover images downloading or any indexing.\r\n\r\n    So **mmp** stay as simple as possible: as a simple `play a folder content or a file music player`, with no internet connection required anyway, only your music folder and **mmp**.\r\n\r\nThis is because i implement it at start only for personnal usage so it´s a personnal requirement builded program,\r\n\r\nbut finally i decide to distribute it because **mmp** is so easy, as in the concept as the short source code, so that you can use it like this or modify it, in the way you want, according the **GPLv3** license terms.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n   \r\n  :depends: libgtk-3-dev libvlc-dev vlc-nox\r\n\r\n  First run\r\n   \r\n  ```bash\r\n   \r\n    $ ./configure\r\n  \r\n  ```\r\n\r\n  to sea if you satisfy all the requirement for compiling and installing Micro Media Player.\r\n\r\n  Then simply enter:\r\n\r\n  ```bash\r\n   \r\n    $ make\r\n\r\n    $ sudo make install  \r\n  \r\n  ```  \r\n\r\n  To build and install the program.\r\n\r\n  Enjoy to use Micro Media Player.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Credits\r\n\r\n  Thanks to my **mother**, my **family** and to the **doctors**.\r\n\r\n  Stay away from **drugs**: **drugs destroy your brain and your life**.\r\n\r\n  Thanks to my **uncle** too, who let free usage of his **Mac O.S**, for the development of **MMP** version 1.0.0,\r\n\r\n  during my holydays where I write this lines from...\r\n\r\n  By the way **Mac O.S** seems to me a little bit strange the first times but i think it's good stuff finally.\r\n\r\n  I think that **Mac** compile right with his ``C++ compiler`` but not verbose enough about errors. The **Mac** ``terminal`` is near enough from the **Linux** ``terminal``, so that i could work...\r\n\r\n  The strange is that there is **no** Mac version of **mmp** available due of the lack of time and the fact that i get no **Mac** packaging knowledge.\r\n    \r\n  But a debian package is available at [mmp-2.0.deb](http://www.open-source-projects.net/Micro_Music_Player/Download/py/download_MicroMusicPlayer_deb.cgi)\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\n    Micro Music Player a very simple play a folder or a file music player.\r\n    Copyright (C) 2015  Brüggemann Eddie.\r\n\r\n    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\r\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\r\n    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\r\n    (at your option) any later version.\r\n\r\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\r\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\r\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
