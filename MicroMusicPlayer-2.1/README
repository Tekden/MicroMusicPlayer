What mmp not does:
******************

**mmp** provide nothing else features:

* No music library indexing feature.

* No database connection for cover images downloading or any
  indexing.

So **mmp** stay as simple as possible: as a simple *play files* or a
*folder content*, with no internet connection required anyway, only
your music folder and **mmp**.

This is because i implement it at start only for personnal usage so
it´s a personnal requirement builded program,

but finally i decide to distribute it because **mmp** is so easy, as
in the concept as the short source code, so that you can use it like
this or modify it, in the way you want, according to the terms of the
**GPLv3** license.


Changelogs
**********


mmp version 2.0
===============

has totally change the audio engine and the images management:

Instead of using the "SDL2_mixer" library it use the "libvlc" library
(with which the famous media player **vlc** is build).

The "opencv-3.0.0" library is no more needed. **mmp** uses "gtk+-3.0"
for the cover images resizing.

Nothing change for the user except that the program will never more
crashing due of my missuse of the "SDL2_mixer" library.


mmp Version 2.1
===============

Introduce some few new usefull concept.

**mmp** use some few metadatas from the files with fallback if not
found for:

   1. Formatting the displaying to the user of the current playing
      music file, in following manner:

         N° of track Artist - Title Duration

   2. Getting the duration of the music file what permit:

      * To display the duration of the music file to the user.

      * Provide a timeline bar which you can drag the slider to
        change the current position in the track.

   3. Displaying a timeline bar.

   4. Getting the correct cover image.

      Because in version below 2.1 it could append that **mmp**
      display the back face of the a cover image or any other image.

      note:
         It can still append but very much least as before: per
         example if **mmp** cannot access the metadata, but not
         necessarily in this case (because of fallback success).


Credits
*******

   Thanks to my beloved **mother**, my **family** and to the
   **doctors**.

   **Stay away** from **drugs**: **drugs destroy your brain and your
   life**.

   Thanks to my **uncle** too, who let free usage of his **Mac O.S**,
   for the development of **mmp** version **1.0**,

   during my holydays where i write this lines from...

      By the way **Mac O.S** seems to me a little bit strange the
      first times but i think it’s good stuff finally.

      I think that **Mac** compile right with his "C++ compiler" but
      not verbose enough about errors. The **Mac** "terminal" is near
      enough from the **Linux** "terminal", so that i could work...

      The strange is that there is **no** Mac version of **mmp**
      available due of the lack of time and the fact that i get no
      **Mac** packaging knowledge.
