@strong{MMP} is an easy music folder or files playing concept music player so that you only have to select a folder which contains some @strong{MMP} compatible music file(s) to play it content, or comptable music files.

After listing the folder content or file(s) and searching for an cover image to display ; @strong{MMP} will give you full access to the music folder content or file(s) and display the album cover image if found.

A cover image in form of a compatible image file (filetypes: @code{*.jpg}, @code{*.jpe}, @code{*.jpeg}, @code{*.png}, @code{*.bmp}, @code{*.dib}, or @code{*.tif}, @code{*.tiff}) resized to @strong{MMP} 3 differents, free choosable, fixed interface sizes (@strong{little}, @strong{middle}, @strong{big} sizes).

Then @strong{MMP} play the folder content or the  selected music files in lexicographic sorted order (so as your O.S present you the files) or in shuffle mode.

@chapter What MMP not does:


@strong{MMP} provide nothing else features:


@itemize +

@item 
No music library indexing feature.

@item 
No database connection for cover images downloading or any indexing.
@end itemize

So @strong{MMP} stay as simple as possible: as a simple @emph{play files} or a @emph{folder content}, with no internet connection required anyway, only your music folder and @strong{MMP}.

This is because i implement it at start only for personnal usage so it´s a personnal requirement builded program,

but finally i decide to distribute it because @strong{MMP} is so easy, as in the concept as the short source code, so that you can use it like this or modify it, in the way you want, according to the terms of the @strong{GPLv3} license.

@section MMP version 2.0


has totally change the audio engine and the images management:

Instead of using the @code{SDL2_mixer} library it use the @code{libvlc} library (with which the famous media player @strong{vlc} is build).

The @code{opencv-3.0.0} library is no more needed. @strong{MMP} uses @code{gtk+-3.0} for the cover images resizing.

Nothing change for the user except that the program will never more crashing due of my missuse of the @code{SDL2_mixer} library.

@node MMP Version 2 1,,MMP version 2 0,Changelogs
@anchor{README/README mmp-version-2-1}@anchor{c}
@section MMP Version 2.1


Introduce some few new usefull concept.

@strong{MMP} use some few metadatas from the files with fallback if not found for:

@quotation


@enumerate 

@item 
Formatting the displaying to the user of the current playing music file, in following manner:
@end enumerate

@quotation

@example
N° of track Artist - Title Duration
@end example
@end quotation


@enumerate 2

@item 
Getting the duration of the music file what permit:
@end enumerate

@quotation


@itemize +

@item 
To display the duration of the music file to the user.

@item 
Provide a timeline bar which you can drag the slider to change the current position in the track.
@end itemize
@end quotation


@enumerate 3

@item 
Displaying a timeline bar.

@item 
Getting the correct cover image.
@end enumerate

@quotation

Because in version below 2.1 it could append that @strong{MMP} display the back face of the a cover image or any other image.

@*note: 
It can still append but very much least as before: per example if @strong{MMP} cannot access the metadata, but not necessarily in this case (because of fallback success).

Thanks to my beloved @strong{mother}, my @strong{family} and to the @strong{doctors}.

@strong{Stay away} from @strong{drugs}: @strong{drugs destroy your brain and your life}.

Thanks to my @strong{uncle} too, who let free usage of his @strong{Mac O.S}, for the development of @strong{MMP} version @strong{1.0},

during my holydays where i write this lines from...

@quotation

By the way @strong{Mac O.S} seems to me a little bit strange the first times but i think it’s good stuff finally.

I think that @strong{Mac} compile right with his @code{C++ compiler} but not verbose enough about errors. The @strong{Mac} @code{terminal} is near enough from the @strong{Linux} @code{terminal}, so that i could work...

The strange is that there is @strong{no} Mac version of @strong{MMP} available due of the lack of time and the fact that i get no @strong{Mac} packaging knowledge.
